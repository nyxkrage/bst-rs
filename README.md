## Personal Goals 

One of the main motivations for starting this is to fully grasp the following concepts

- [x] Ownership/Borrowing
- [x] Generic Traits
- [x] Lifetimes

I am now more confident programming around these concepts and can discuss and reason
about different implementations.

## Inspiration

The book [Learning Rust With Too Many Linked Lists]() inspired me to try and
implement a Binary Search Trees within the language. I had also been wanting to create
my first library for other crates to use.
